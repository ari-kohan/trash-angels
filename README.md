# Trash Angels

Is there trash in your city? There certainly is in mine. And I want to help make our public spaces a little cleaner and nicer.

Trash angels is an app to help civically-minded people clean up their neighborhoods.

## Features
An easy to use map interface
- Mark when you see trash in your location
- Mark that trash has been picked up
Thats it!

No account needed to start cleaning up trash.
If you would like to recieve push notificatins when new trash is reported in your area, you will need to create an account. Only your account id is stored in the cloud, all other data lives on your phone.
